Please generate the entire Python file based on the following code.

Requirements:
1. Add complete and clear docstrings for every class and method, describing inputs (`:param`) and outputs (`:return:`) using reStructuredText style.
2. Include explicit type hints for all method parameters and return types, including `None` where appropriate.
3. Keep the existing logic and structure unchanged.
4. Ensure consistent formatting and readability throughout the file.
